# Blockchain-Medical-Records-Project
This is a Project to explore how medical record keeping could work on the Ethereum Blockchain.

# Description and functionalities
Users can keep track of their medical records on chain, not depending of a single entity and making their data accessable to the parties they allow. Ideally, access to data should be convenient while making sure that the privacy of the users is preserved. For now only a backend smart prototype was developed and a frontend is to be done.
